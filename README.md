## Elecctro React Challenge

The challenge is to create a simple single page application (SPA) for managing a local “to-do list”.

The application should allow the user to;
- List the items on the to-do list, optionally filtered by state and sorted.
- Add an item to the list.
- Edit an item on the list (i.e., change its description or mark it as complete).
- Remove an item from the list.
